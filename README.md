What is this? This is a project that showcases how to use NgRx for an existing project.

The project can be ran completely on your local machine.

The frontend is an Angular application.

The backend is a local Node Express server running on port 1122.

To start it locally, run `npm run start` and it will run both the front and backend together.

For the version of the project without NgRx pull the branch `before-ngrx`.

For the version of the project with NgRx pull the branch `after-ngrx`.
